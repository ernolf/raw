# Raw â€” Nextcloud raw file server

Raw simply returns any requested file, so you can link directly to a file itself (i.e. without any of NextCloud's interface around it). This enables you to host static web pages, images or other files, for example to link/embed them elsewhere on the web.

For security and privacy, the content is served with a [Content-Security-Policy][] header. This header instructs browsers to not load any remote content, nor execute any scripts that it may contain (of course, the downside is that your web pages cannot use javascript for interactivity).

## Usage

The common usage is to first share a file and enable public access through a link. If the share link is

    `https://my-nextcloud/s/aBc123DeF456xyZ`

then this app will provide access to the raw file at

    `https://my-nextcloud/apps/raw/s/aBc123DeF456xyZ`

If the share is a folder, the files within it are accessible as e.g.

    `https://my-nextcloud/apps/raw/s/aBc123DeF456xyZ/path/to/file`

The /s/ can also be omitted, so

    `https://my-nextcloud/aBc123DeF456xyZ`

or 

    `https://my-nextcloud/apps/raw/aBc123DeF456xyZ/path/to/file`

also works.


A user can also access their own private files. For example, a file named `test.html` in anansi's Documents folder would be available at

    `https://my-nextcloud/apps/raw/u/anansi/Documents/test.html`.

The /u/ can **not** be omitted, so

    `https://my-nextcloud/apps/raw/anansi/Documents/test.html`.

does **not** work.


## Token-Based Access Restrictions for Raw Content

The app makes use of a **whitelist mechanism** to control which tokens can be used to access raw content. This mechanism ensures that only explicitly defined tokens or tokens matching predefined patterns are allowed.

### Configuration Options

One or both of the following arrays in the `config/config.php` of your Nextcloud instance must be defined, to configure token-based whitelist restrictions:

- **`allowed_raw_tokens`**  
  An array of explicitly allowed tokens. These tokens must exactly match those used in raw links.

- **`allowed_raw_token_wildcards`**  
  An array of wildcard patterns (`*`) that allow for flexible matching of multiple tokens. Wildcards are translated into regular expressions for dynamic validation.

#### Example Configuration

```php
'allowed_raw_tokens' =>
array (
    0 => 'scripts',
    1 => 'modules',
    2 => 'includes',
    3 => 'html',
),
'allowed_raw_token_wildcards' =>
array (
    0 => '*sufix',
    1 => 'prefix*',
    2 => 'prefix*sufix',
    3 => '*infix*',
),
```

In this configuration:
- Tokens such as `scripts`, `modules`, and `html` are explicitly allowed.
- Wildcard patterns like `*_json` or `nc-*` enable flexible matching, e.g., `data_json` or `nc-example`.

### Usage with Human-Readable Tokens

In the example above, the share links were created using the [cfg_share_links][] app. This app allows generating human-readable tokens instead of randomly generated ones, making links more meaningful and easier to manage. 

While the use of **cfg_share_links** is not mandatory, its installation is recommended for better control and usability when creating share links for raw access eg for html pages.

For example:
- Instead of a random token like `aBc123DeF456xyZ`, you can use a meaningful token such as `html`, `javascript` or `data_json` for shared directories or prepend prefixes, append sufixes or include infixes to enable them as wildcard.

This approach enhances both usability and security by allowing administrators to control access to raw links more effectively while keeping token names meaningful and consistent.


### Best Practices

Review and update allowed_raw_tokens and allowed_raw_token_wildcards periodically to align with your security requirements.
Use meaningful share tokens wherever possible for improved manageability.
Validate CSP rules and token configurations in a test environment before applying them in production.

## Conditional Requests / Cache validation with ETags and Last-Modified

`raw` supports conditional requests (cache validation) using ETags together with the `If-None-Match` header and also supports `Last-Modified` / `If-Modified-Since` semantics.

- **ETag / If-None-Match**: The server sends an `ETag` header identifying the current representation of the file. If the client sends `If-None-Match: "<ETag>"` and the value matches, the server responds with `304 Not Modified` and no response body. The wildcard `If-None-Match: *` is also supported.
- **Last-Modified / If-Modified-Since**: When the server can read file modification time (mtime) it sets a `Last-Modified` header. The server will honor `If-Modified-Since` when `If-None-Match` is not present. If the client date is equal to or newer than the file mtime, the server responds with `304 Not Modified`.
- **Unix timestamp convenience**: For convenience, `If-Modified-Since` accepts either a RFC-style HTTP-date (recommended) **or** a plain Unix timestamp (seconds). The server will trim optional quotes. Note that RFC-style dates are the standard and should be preferred for interoperability.
- **Cookie policy**: `raw` will attempt to avoid sending cookies in responses by removing any `Set-Cookie` headers that PHP/Nextcloud may have queued for the current request. This prevents PHP-emitted cookies from being delivered to clients.

### Examples

Get file and see headers + body (returns ETag and Last-Modified):
```bash
curl -i 'https://your.nextcloud/apps/raw/.../file.ext'
```

Conditional GET using ETag (should return 304 if it matches):
```bash
curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: "<ETag>"' 'https://your.nextcloud/apps/raw/.../file.ext'
```

Conditional GET using HTTP-date:
```bash
curl -i -H 'If-Modified-Since: "Sun, 25 May 2025 21:40:02 GMT"' 'https://your.nextcloud/apps/raw/.../file.ext'
```

Conditional GET using Unix timestamp (convenience):
```bash
curl -i -H 'If-Modified-Since: "1748209203"' 'https://your.nextcloud/apps/raw/.../file.ext'
```

Example request header (replace `<ETag>` with the ETag value returned by the server):
```bash
If-None-Match: "<ETag>"
```

The wildcard `If-None-Match: *` is also supported (it matches any existing representation) and will return a 304 if the resource exits.
```bash
curl -i -H 'If-None-Match: *' 'https://your.nextcloud/apps/raw/.../file.ext'
```
